# PyTeVCat

PyTeVCat is a small Python project which plots TeV gamma-ray sources on a ROOT canvas. This is not a spin-off
project by the official [TeVCat](http://tevcat.uchicago.edu) developers.

```shell
$ pip install pytevcat
$ python
```
```python
>>> import tevcat
>>> viewer = tevcat.Viewer()
```

You need to have ROOT installed on your machine.
